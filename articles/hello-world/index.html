      <h1>Hello World!</h1>
      <p>Congratulations, you've discovered the very first article on my personal blog! In fact, this also serves as a template for new articles. So, if you want to create a new entry, simply copy this file and make the necessary changes.</p>
      <p>I am a fan of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">"Keep it simple"</a> principle: Unnecessary complexity should be avoided. Therefore, this webpage should be easy to use, understand, and modify.</p>
      <h2>Behind the Scenes</h2>
      <p>This article is written in plain <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">HTML</a>: The standard language behind every Internet site.
      <p>Learning HTML as a beginner might take some time, but you can find <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">plenty of tutorials</a> to help you. You can view the source code of this web page by clicking on <i>View Source</i> in the menu of your web browser.
      <p>Additionally, I use <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/">CSS</a> styles to implement a custom design, font and layout.</p>
      <h2>Hosting</h2>
      <p>All of the files are static, so the website can easily be deployed to any hosting service. For example, I host this website on <a href="https://github.com/jan-bausch/jan-bausch.com">Github Pages</a> together with a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site">custom domain</a>.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>This is how you can build a simple web page. Feel free to use this template to create your own! </p>
